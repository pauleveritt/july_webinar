Refactoring
===========

Professional tools such as PyCharm can do refactoring work for you,
fixing code across your project.

Let's rename our file, template, and a route.

Features Shown
--------------

- Extensive refactorings, such as rename

- Actions findable by menus, key bindings, and search

- Rich Python console configured for current project

#. Make ``hello.py`` which imports from ``main.py``

#. Use refactor to change ``main.py`` to ``app.py``

#. Show that it changed in: VCS, Run Configuration, ``hello.py``

#. Safe Delete ``hello.py`` (and show that it is gone from VCS)

#. Rename template and route to be todo-focused.

#. "Actions": Show the different ways that Refactor Rename can be invoked

#. Open the Python Console and import a function, then close
